# Configs
this is specifically a single importable npm package that centralises our common configs for javascript development, including:

* eslint
* babel
* prettier
* stylelint

It also contains basic config files, that should be placed in the root of the project when installed.

## Get Started
While your project will require some root dependencies to be installed, this package should vastly simplify the rather arduous task of setting this up and maintaining these configs across multiple projects.

## Use At Your Own Risk
While this is openly available and licensed under MIT, we have developed it solely for our own purposes, and provide zero warranties.
